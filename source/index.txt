that introduces basic systems administration concepts and topics

Meta
----

Current
~~~~~~~

In most cases, paths within tychoish.net redirect to pages on
`tychoish.com`_ wiki, except for the projects outlined
above. `tychoish.com`_ hosts the majority of tychoish related content,
and given the use case 

.. _`tychoish.com`: http://tychoish.com

Future
~~~~~~

In the future, it might make sense to: 

- move the existing tychoish.com content to tychoish.org to highlight
  and develop the wiki aspect of the site.
  
- replace existing `tychogaren.com`_ with a slightly expanded
  tychoish.net. 

- launch a new blog on tychoish.com using a slightly more
  contemporary/conventional approximation of a blog.
